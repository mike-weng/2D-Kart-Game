Getting Slick to work under Linux.

1. export CLASSPATH=src:lib/slick.jar:lib/lwjgl.jar:$CLASSPATH
   Now should be able to compile.
2. javac src/*.java
3. To run: java -Djava.library.path=lib Game

Note that slick/lib/natives-linux.jar (from the slick zip file) is in lib.

Note that CLASSPATH is for loading .class files (you can put directories or
.jar files here).
-Djava.library.path is for loading .so files.
